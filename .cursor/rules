# ComicAI Cursor Rules

# All Python files must start with their import statements.
# Use absolute imports rather than relative imports when possible.
# Use Python 3.8+ syntax.
# All functions and classes must include docstrings in English.
# Add comments to explain non-trivial logic.
# Code must be readable, formatted according to PEP8.
# Handle exceptions gracefully and display user-friendly error messages.
# When using APIs, always check and handle response status.
# Default to function-based structure; use classes only if justified.
# Prefer type hints for function arguments and return values.
# For longer tasks, display a progress indicator in the Streamlit UI.
# The app must use Streamlit for all user interaction.
# All external dependencies must be listed in requirements.txt **with specific version numbers**.
# Include an MIT license header at the top of each file.
# For AI services, prefer free/local options (Ollama, Hugging Face Spaces).
# Use environment variables for API keys and configuration.
# Implement proper error handling for AI model failures.
# Add logging for debugging and monitoring.
# Follow the single responsibility principle for modules.
