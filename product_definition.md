## 🔄 Core Flow (MVP)

    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#fce4ec
```

### 1. **User Input**
The user enters a short story, scenario, or idea in a text box.

### 2. **Panel Breakdown**
A local LLM (e.g., TinyLlama, Qwen) divides the story into 3–5 scene descriptions (comic panels).

### 3. **Image Generation**
For each scene, a prompt is sent to a free text-to-image API (Hugging Face Spaces – Stable Diffusion) to create an original illustration.

### 4. **Comic Presentation**
The generated images and scene texts are displayed together as a comic strip in a Streamlit web app.

### 5. **Download/Share** *(Optional)*
The user can download their comic as images or share it.
